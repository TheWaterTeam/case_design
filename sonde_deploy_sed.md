## Deploying a sonde in sand, silt, or mud sediment
* Cross two pieces of rebar and tie together at the top with Zip Ties.
* link Zip-Ties attached to the rebar to a large Zip-Tie that is wrapped around the sonde.
* Before adding the large Zip-Tie around the sonde, wrap several layers of duct tape around the sonde to improve the grip of the Zip-Tie.
